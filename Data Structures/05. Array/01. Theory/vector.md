## Vectors:

- Vectors are object of vector class. They function similar to array with added benifits.

## Advantages of vector over array:

- Dynamic size
- Rich library function like: find, erase, insert etc
- Easy to know size eg: myVector.size() (in array we've to do: sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]))
- Can be returned from a function (array are always received as pointers)
- Copying a vector is very easy eg: myVect_1 = myVect_2
