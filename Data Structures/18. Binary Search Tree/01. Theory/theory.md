## Definition:

The binary search tree is one of the types of binary tree that has the value of all the nodes in the left subtree less than or equal to the root node, and the value of all the nodes in a right subtree are greater than or equal to the value of the root node.

## Properties:

1. For every node, key in left side are smaller and key in right side are greater

2. All keys are typically considered as distinct

3. Like linked list, it is linked data structures

4. Implementation in C++ as map, set, multimap, multiset

5. Search: O(log n), Insert: O(log n), Delete: O(log n), Find closest: O(log n)
