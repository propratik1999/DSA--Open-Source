## Space complexity:

- Order of growth of memory ( or RAM ) in terms of input size.

<br/>

## Space complexity of some function:

- <strong>
    Constant space : 
  </strong>

  ```
  int getSum(int n){
      return n*(n+1)/2;
  }
  ```

  For this function, the complexity is: O(1) because there is only one
  variable n, so amount of memory doesn't grow in terms of input size.
  <br/>

  ```
  int getSum(int n){
      int sum=0;

      for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
          sum+=i;

      return sum;
  }
  ```

  For this function also, the complexity is: O(1) because there are only three
  variable n, sum and i, so amount of memory space doesn't grow in terms of input size.
  <br/>

- <strong>
    Linear space : 
  </strong>

  ```
  int arrSum(int arr[], int n){
      int sum=0;

      for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
          sum+=arr[i];

      return sum;
  }
  ```

  The array size depends on n. So we the growth is: &#952;(n)

<br></br>

## Auxiliary space:

- Order of growth of <strong>extra space</strong> in terms of input size.
  <br/>

- <strong>
    Auxilary space complexity of linear space: 
  </strong>

  ```
  int arrSum(int arr[], int n){
      int sum=0;

      for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
          sum+=arr[i];

      return sum;
  }
  ```

  It needs linear space only for input, It doesn't use any extra array to do any computation.<br/>
  Auxilary space : &#952;(1)<br/>
  space complexity : &#952;(n)

  <br/>

- <strong>
     Auxilary space complexity recursion: 
  </strong>

  ```
  int fun(int n){
      if(n<=0)
          retrn 0;

      return n + fun(n-1);
  }
  ```

  Although, there is one variable i.e. n, the aux space is &#952; (n+1) = &#952; (n).<br/>
  Because the function call take memory in call stack and at one moment when the last function <br/> is being executed the total number of function call is n+1.

<br></br>

- ### NOTE :

  Space complexity is less used.<br/> Auxilary space is more used because it gives more information.<br/>

  | Sorting algorithm          | Auxilary space                     |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | Selection, Heap, Insertion | &#952; (1) (don't use extra array) |
  | Merge                      | &#952; (n) (use extra array)       |
  | Quick                      | &#952; (log n) (use extra array)   |

  we can't compare them with space complexity because they're same i.e. &#952; (n). So we use auxilary space.
