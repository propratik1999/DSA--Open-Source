    Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline a
    nd profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of
    time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a
    time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed
    by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and
    the number of jobs done.

    ALGORITHM:

    1. Sort jobs in decreasing order of profit
    2. Initialize res as first job and assign latest possible job
    3. Do the following for remaining (n-1) jobs
        a. If this job can't be added => ignore
        2. Else add to latest possible slot
