 * No matter how many times the array's rotated,
 * One half of array will always be sorted
 * eg:
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] l < m < h => all sorted
 * [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] l !< m, but m < h => right half sorted
 * [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] l !< m, but m < h => right half sorted
 * [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] l !< m, but m < h => right half sorted
 * [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] l < m and m !< h => left half sorted
 * [3,4,5,6,7,1,2] l < m and m !< h => left half sorted
 * [2,3,4,5,6,7,1] l < m and m !< h => left half sorted
 *
 * similarly:
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6] l < m < h => all sorted
 * [6,1,2,3,4,5] l !< m but, m < h => right half sorted
 * [5,6,1,2,3,4] l !< m but, m < h => right half sorted
