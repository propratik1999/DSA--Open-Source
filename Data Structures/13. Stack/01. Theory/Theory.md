## Operations:

- Push: Adds item in stack
- Pop: Removes item from stack
- Peek: Look at top element
- Top: Returns top element

- Time Complexity of all above operations is O(1)

## Applications:

- Symbol balancing
- Infix to Postfix/Prefix
- Redo-Undo in photoshop
- Forward-Backward in browsers
- Used in algorithm: TOH, Tree Traversal, Histogram problem etc

## Implementations:

- Using array/vector
- Using linked list
