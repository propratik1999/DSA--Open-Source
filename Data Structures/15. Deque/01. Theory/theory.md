## Definition:

- Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends

## Operations:

- insertFront(): Adds an item at the front of Deque.
- insertLast(): Adds an item at the rear of Deque.
- deleteFront(): Deletes an item from front of Deque.
- deleteLast(): Deletes an item from rear of Deque.
- getFront(): Gets the front item from queue.
- getRear(): Gets the last item from queue.
- isEmpty(): Checks whether Deque is empty or not.
- isFull(): Checks whether Deque is full or not.

## Applications:

- Can be used as stack and queue
- Support clockwise and anticlockwise rotation in O(1)
- All applications that queue supports
- Problems like [max of all subarray of size k](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-maximum-maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/), [0-1 BFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-bfs-shortest-path-binary-graph/)

## Implementations:

- Using array/vector
- Using linked list
