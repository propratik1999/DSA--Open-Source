/*
    NOTES:

    ================== pointer to a function ==================
    It is possible to declare a pointer pointing to a function which
    can then be used as an argument in another function. A pointer to
    a function is declared as follows,

    type (*pointer-name)(parameter);
    int (*sum)();   // correct
    int *sum();     // Incorrect

    =========== Problem with function returning pointer ============
    * A function can also return a pointer to the calling function.

    * In this case you must be careful, because local variables of
      function doesn't live outside the function.

    * They have scope only inside the function.

    * Hence if you return a pointer connected to a local variable,
     that pointer will be pointing to nothing when the function ends.

    =========================== solution ============================
    * Either use argument with functions. Because argument passed to
      the functions are declared inside the calling function, hence
      they will live outside the function as well.

    * Or, use static local variables inside the function and return them.
      As static variables have a lifetime until the main() function exits,
      therefore they will be available througout the program.
