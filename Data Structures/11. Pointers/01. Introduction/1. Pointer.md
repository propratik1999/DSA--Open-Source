# Pointer:

## Definition:

- A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location.

- The general syntax of pointer declaration is

  ```
  datatype *pointer_name;
  ```

## Declaration:

- Example of a pointer declaration and initialization.

  ```
  int x = 10;
  int *ptr;       //pointer declaration
  ptr = &x;       //pointer initialization

  int y = 20;
  int *ptr = &y;  // pointer declaration and initialization
  ```

- The data type of the pointer and the variable to which the pointer variable is pointing must be the same.

  ```
  float x;
  int *ptr = &x;       // ERROR, type mismatch
  ```

- While declaring a pointer variable, if it is not assigned to anything then it contains garbage value. Therefore, it is recommended to assign a NULL value to it,

  ```
  int *ptr = NULL;   // initialized with NULL (can be changed later)
  ```

## Access:

- To access the value of the variable, the pointer is <b>dereferenced</b>, using the <b>indirection operator</b> or <b>dereferencing operator</b>, that is: <b>\*</b>

  ```
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>

  int main()
  {

    int x = 10;    // declare and initialize variable
    int *p = &x;   // declare and initialize pointer

    //prints the value of 'x'
    cout << (*p) <<"\n";
    cout << (*&x) <<"\n";

    //prints the address of 'x'
    cout << (&x) <<"\n";
    cout << (p) << "\n";

    //prints address of 'p'
    cout << (&p) << "\n";
  }
  ```

## Remember:

- While declaring/initializing the pointer variable, <b>\*</b> indicates that the variable is a pointer.

- To access the value of a certain address stored by a pointer variable, <b>dereferencing operator \*</b> is used. Here, the <b>\*</b> can be read as <b>'value at'</b>.

- Address operator <b>&</b> (immediately preceding a variable name) returns the address of the variable associated with it. Here, the <b>&</b> can be read as <b>'address of'</b>;

- The datatype of pointer variable and the datatype of variable whose address is stored in this pointer <b>must be same</b>. This is important while dereferencing. eg:

  ```
  int x = 1025    // 00000000 0000000 00000100 0000001
  int *ptr = &x;

  char *p = (char *)ptr;  // typecasting
  cout << (int)*p;        // output = 1

  // since char stores only 1 byte, here the last byte is stored
  ```

- The syntax `*(&x)` should be read as <b>'value at address of x'</b>
