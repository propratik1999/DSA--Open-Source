# Double Pointer:

- When one pointer variable stores the address of another pointer variable, it is known as <b>Pointer to Pointer</b> variable or <b>Double Pointer</b>.

- General syntax for double pointer

  ```
  int *p;       // normal pointer
  int **p1;     // double pointer
  ```

- Program to represent pointer to pointer

  ```
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>

  int main() {

    int  x = 10;
    int  *p1;     // p1 can store the address of variable x
    int  **p2;    // p2 can store address of p1 but not address of 'x'

    p1 = &x;
    p2 = &p1;

    // print address of x
    cout << (&x) << (p1) << (*p2)<< "\n";

    // print value of x
    cout << (x) << *(p1) << *(*p2) << "\n";
  }
  ```
